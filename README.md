# FinanceTracker

a project that tracks your finances in java (and includes concepts of what I would do if i had support for credit card tracking.)

i made this because my teacher wanted to teach us java and i got bored of hearing her say "classes are blueprints for objects" for the entire class period so i decided i would work on something that wouldn't bore me out of class. just so happened that my friends made a bet that i couldn't try to use javafx if i tried. (i don't know what that means but okay)

## run:
i legitmately don't know just mvn build or use the precompiled jars.
